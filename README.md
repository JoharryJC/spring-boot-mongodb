# spring-boot-mongodb
This repository contains a Spring Boot example project for MongoDB.

This project was made in the course "Spring Framework" being helped for the teacher in it and using Robo 3T. He showed us how we can connect the code in Spring Framework 5 with MongoDb running in Docker container and I made the rest of implementation starting with the base project. I have used one class with the configuration annotation to know other way to initialize the database configuration in the project, for this reason this parameters not appears in properties file (in spring5-mongo-recipe-app I have used property file). I have created commands, domains, controllers, repositories, services and so on, to permit the interaction with MongoDB.
